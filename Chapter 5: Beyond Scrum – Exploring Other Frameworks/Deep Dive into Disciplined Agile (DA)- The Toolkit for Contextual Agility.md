**Disciplined Agile (DA)** is fundamentally different from the other frameworks we've explored. It's not a prescriptive methodology like Scrum or XP, but rather a **process decision framework**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DA provides guidance to organizations on how to **choose their way of working (WoW)** in a context-sensitive manner. It recognizes that there is no "one-size-fits-all" Agile approach and that the best way of working depends on the specific situation. DA is designed to be **enterprise-scalable** and covers the entire **solution delivery lifecycle.**

### Key Concepts and Characteristics of Disciplined Agile

#### 1. Process Decision Framework (Choose Your WoW)
- **Description:** DA's core concept is "Choose Your Way of Working" (WoW). It provides a vast toolkit of strategies, practices, and guidance, allowing teams to select and tailor their processes based on their unique context.
- **"Right Tool for the Job" Mentality:** DA promotes a pragmatic approach of selecting the "right tool for the job" from a wide range of Agile and Lean techniques.

> [!TIP]
> **Key Implications of "Choose Your WoW":**
> - **No Prescriptive Methodology:** DA does not prescribe a single, fixed methodology.
> - **Context-Driven Approach:** Emphasizes that the best way of working is context-dependent.
> - **Goal-Driven Guidance:** Organized around process goals (e.g., "Explore Scope") rather than rigid processes.
> - **Continuous Improvement:** Encourages teams to continuously inspect and adapt their WoW.

#### 2. Hybrid and Pragmatic Approach
- **Description:** DA is inherently hybrid, drawing from and integrating practices from various Agile and Lean methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean Startup, and many others.
- **"Beyond Agile" Perspective:** DA takes a broader perspective than just "Agile software development," encompassing the entire solution delivery lifecycle and business agility.

> [!NOTE]
> DA is designed to be pragmatic and realistic, acknowledging the complexities of real-world organizations. It avoids dogmatic adherence to any single methodology and encourages practical, context-sensitive choices.

#### 3. Full Solution Delivery Lifecycle
- **Description:** DA covers the entire solution delivery lifecycle, from project initiation and inception to delivery, operations, and retirement.
- **Lifecycle Coverage:**
    - **Inception:** Project initiation, visioning, initial planning.
    - **Construction:** Iterative and incremental development.
    - **Transition:** Deployment, release, and handover to operations.
    - **Ongoing Operations:** Support, maintenance, and continuous improvement.
    - **Retirement (End-of-Life):** Managing the decommissioning of the solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DA emphasizes optimizing the entire **value stream** across the lifecycle, not just the development phase.

#### 4. Enterprise Scalability and Business Agility
- **Description:** DA is designed for enterprise-scale Agile adoption. It provides guidance for scaling Agile beyond individual teams to the entire organization.
- **Scaling Considerations:**
    - Coordination Across Teams
    - Program and Portfolio Management
    - Enterprise Architecture and Governance
    - Business Agility

> [!NOTE]
> DA is compatible with and can help organizations choose and tailor other scaling frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, and Nexus based on their needs.

#### 5. Goal-Driven Process Guidance
- **Description:** DA provides process guidance organized around process goals. For each goal, a decision tree or goal diagram outlines various process options, trade-offs, and factors to consider.
- **Example Goal Diagram: "Address Risk" Goal:** Might present options like "Risk-Value Prioritization," "Risk Workshops," or "Early Prototyping," and guide teams to choose appropriate strategies based on their project's risk profile.

#### 6. People-First Approach
- **Description:** While DA provides process guidance, it still emphasizes the importance of people and teams. It recognizes that effective processes are those that empower and enable people.
- **Key Tenets:**
    - **Team Empowerment:** Encourages self-organizing teams to make their own process decisions.
    - **Skill Development:** Recognizes the importance of continuous learning.
    - **Collaboration:** Values effective team collaboration and communication.

### The Disciplined Agile Toolkit

> [!NOTE]
> DA provides a "toolkit" of resources and guidance, including:
> - **Goal Diagrams:** Visual decision trees for process goals.
> - **Process Blades:** Descriptions of various process areas (e.g., "DevOps," "Portfolio Management").
> - **Practices and Techniques Library:** A vast library of Agile and Lean practices to choose from.
> - **DA Browser and Tooling:** Online tools to navigate the toolkit and tailor a WoW.
> - **Training and Certification:** Programs for individuals and organizations adopting DA.

### Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)
Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) is the primary "process blade" within the DA toolkit focused on solution delivery. It is a people-first, learning-oriented hybrid Agile approach.

> [!TIP]
> #### DAD Lifecycle Options
> DAD offers various lifecycle options to choose from, depending on project needs:
> - **Agile Lifecycle (Scrum-based):** Iterative, for projects with well-understood requirements.
> - **Lean Lifecycle (Kanban-based):** Flow-based, for maintenance, support, or continuous evolution.
> - **Continuous Delivery (Agile & Lean):** Optimized for frequent releases.
> - **Exploration Lifecycle:** For highly innovative or uncertain projects.
> - **Program Lifecycle:** For large programs involving multiple teams.

> - **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Allows teams to evolve their processes over time.
> - **Supports Business Agility:** Aims to extend Agile principles beyond IT to the entire organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### When is Disciplined Agile (DA) Most Suitable?
> - For organizations seeking a **context-driven** Agile approach.
> - For **complex projects or programs** where scaling and governance are important.
> - For organizations with **diverse project types** and needs.
> - When the goal is to **scale Agile enterprise-wide** and achieve business agility.
> - For organizations wanting to go **"Beyond Scrum and Kanban."**
> - For organizations in **regulated industries** that need to incorporate governance and compliance.

### Challenges and Considerations

> [!WARNING]
> #### Challenges with Disciplined Agile (DA) Adoption
> - **Complexity of the Toolkit:** The vast toolkit can be overwhelming initially.
> - **Requires Process Decision-Making Skills:** Teams must learn how to tailor their WoW, not just follow steps.
> - **Potential for "Analysis Paralysis":** With so many options, teams might overthink process choices.
> - **Less Prescriptive:** Can be challenging for teams new to Agile who seek a structured starting point.
> - **Requires Training and Coaching:** Effective adoption often requires expert guidance to navigate the toolkit.

### Conclusion

> [!NOTE]
> **Disciplined Agile (DA) offers a unique and powerful approach by providing a process decision framework rather than a prescriptive methodology.** Its context-driven, hybrid, and enterprise-scalable nature makes it a valuable toolkit for organizations seeking true business agility. By empowering teams to choose their way of working, DA enables organizations to be more flexible, responsive, and effective in delivering value across the entire solution delivery lifecycle.
