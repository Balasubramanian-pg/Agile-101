**Disciplined Agile (DA)** is fundamentally different from the other frameworks we've explored. It's not a prescriptive methodology like Scrum or XP, but rather a **process decision framework**. DA provides guidance to organizations on how to **choose their way of working (WoW)** in a context-sensitive manner. It recognizes that there is no "one-size-fits-all" Agile approach and that the best way of working depends on the specific situation, project type, team context, and organizational goals. DA is designed to be **enterprise-scalable** and covers the entire **"solution delivery lifecycle,"** extending beyond just software development to encompass all aspects of delivering business value.

**Key Concepts and Characteristics of Disciplined Agile:**

1. **Process Decision Framework (Choose Your WoW):**
    - **Description:** DA's core concept is "Choose Your Way of Working" (WoW). It provides a vast toolkit of strategies, practices, and guidance, allowing teams and organizations to select and tailor their processes based on their unique context and needs.
    - **No Prescriptive Methodology:** DA does not prescribe a single, fixed methodology to follow. Instead, it offers a wide range of options and helps teams make informed decisions about which practices and processes are most appropriate for them.
    - **Context-Driven Approach:** DA emphasizes that the best way of working is context-dependent. Factors like project size, team distribution, regulatory compliance, domain complexity, and organizational culture influence the optimal approach.
    - **Goal-Driven Guidance:** DA is organized around process goals (e.g., "Explore Scope," "Manage Risk," "Coordinate Activities") rather than rigid processes. For each goal, DA presents various process options and trade-offs to consider.
    - **Continuous Improvement and Evolution:** DA encourages teams to continuously inspect and adapt their way of working, evolving their processes over time based on learning and feedback.
    - **"Right Tool for the Job" Mentality:** DA promotes a pragmatic approach of selecting the "right tool for the job" from a wide range of Agile and Lean techniques.
2. **Hybrid and Pragmatic Approach:**
    - **Description:** DA is inherently hybrid, drawing from and integrating practices from various Agile and Lean methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean Startup, Agile Modeling, and many others.
    - **Beyond Scrum and Kanban:** DA extends beyond Scrum and Kanban, recognizing that these frameworks are often just starting points for enterprise agility. DA provides guidance for addressing complexities and scaling challenges that are not fully covered by basic Scrum or Kanban.
    - **"Beyond Agile" Perspective:** DA takes a broader perspective than just "Agile software development," encompassing the entire solution delivery lifecycle and business agility.
    - **Pragmatic and Realistic:** DA is designed to be pragmatic and realistic, acknowledging the complexities of real-world organizations and projects. It avoids dogmatic adherence to any single methodology and encourages practical, context-sensitive choices.
3. **Full Solution Delivery Lifecycle:**
    - **Description:** DA covers the entire solution delivery lifecycle, from project initiation and inception to delivery, operations, and retirement. It goes beyond just the software development phase and addresses all aspects of delivering value to customers.
    - **Lifecycle Coverage:**
        - **Inception:** Project initiation, visioning, initial planning.
        - **Construction:** Iterative and incremental development (similar to sprints in Scrum).
        - **Transition:** Deployment, release, and handover to operations.
        - **Ongoing Operations:** Support, maintenance, and continuous improvement of the delivered solution.
        - **Retirement (End-of-Life):** Managing the retirement or decommissioning of the solution.
    - **Value Stream Focus:** DA emphasizes optimizing the entire value stream across the lifecycle, not just the development phase.
4. **Enterprise Scalability and Business Agility:**
    - **Description:** DA is designed for enterprise-scale Agile adoption. It provides guidance for scaling Agile beyond individual teams to larger programs, portfolios, and the entire organization.
    - **Scaling Considerations:**
        - Coordination Across Teams: DA addresses challenges of coordinating multiple teams working on the same product or program.
        - Program and Portfolio Management: DA provides guidance for Agile portfolio management and aligning Agile initiatives with business strategy.
        - Enterprise Architecture and Governance: DA considers enterprise architecture, governance, and compliance in Agile contexts.
        - Business Agility: DA aims to achieve business agility â€“ agility across the entire organization, not just IT.
    - **Scaling Frameworks Integration:** DA is compatible with and integrates with other scaling frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, and Nexus. It can help organizations choose and tailor scaling frameworks based on their needs.
5. **Goal-Driven Process Guidance:**
    - **Description:** DA provides process guidance organized around process goals rather than prescriptive steps. For each goal, DA presents a decision tree or goal diagram that outlines various process options, trade-offs, and factors to consider when making process choices.
    - **Goal Diagram Approach:**
        - Process Goals (e.g., "Address Risk," "Form Team," "Grow Team Members"): DA identifies key process goals that teams need to achieve in a project.
        - Process Options (Practices and Techniques): For each goal, DA presents various process options (practices, techniques, strategies) that can be used to achieve the goal.
        - Decision Factors and Trade-offs: DA outlines factors to consider when choosing between different process options and highlights the trade-offs associated with each option.
        - Contextual Guidance: The goal diagrams help teams make context-sensitive process decisions based on their specific situation.
    - **Example Goal Diagram: "Address Risk" Goal:** Might present options like "Risk-Value Prioritization," "Risk-Based Milestones," "Risk Workshops," "Early Prototyping," and guide teams to choose appropriate risk management strategies based on project risk profile, team experience, and other factors.
6. **People-First Approach:**
    - **Description:** While DA provides process guidance, it still emphasizes the importance of people and teams. It recognizes that effective processes are those that empower and enable people to work effectively.
    - **Team Empowerment:** DA encourages teams to be self-organizing and make their own process decisions within the framework's guidance.
    - **Skill Development and Learning:** DA recognizes the importance of continuous learning and skill development for team members.
    - **Collaboration and Communication:** DA values effective team collaboration and communication as essential for project success.

**The Disciplined Agile Toolkit:**

DA provides a "toolkit" of resources and guidance, including:

- **Goal Diagrams:** Visual decision trees for process goals, outlining process options and decision factors.
- **Process Blades:** Descriptions of various process areas (e.g., "Agile Software Development," "DevOps," "Portfolio Management," "Value Stream Management") within the DA framework.
- **Practices and Techniques Library:** A vast library of Agile and Lean practices, techniques, and strategies that teams can choose from.
