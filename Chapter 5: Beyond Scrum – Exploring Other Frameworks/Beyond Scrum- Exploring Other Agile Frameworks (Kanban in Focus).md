While Scrum is a widely adopted and well-known Agile framework, it's important to recognize that Agile is an umbrella term encompassing various methodologies. Let's explore **Kanban** as a prominent example of an Agile framework that offers a different approach compared to Scrum.

### Kanban: Visualize, Limit, Flow

> [!NOTE]
> Kanban, meaning "visual signal" in Japanese, is a **lean and Agile framework focused on visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress (WIP), and maximizing flow**. Unlike Scrum, Kanban is **not strictly time-boxed** and doesn't prescribe specific roles or events. It's more **evolutionary and less prescriptive**, making it adaptable to various contexts.

**Key Principles of Kanban:**

### 1. Visualize the Workflow
Kanban heavily relies on a **visual board (Kanban board)** to represent the workflow. This board typically consists of columns representing different stages of work (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Testing," "Done").

- **Cards (Kanban cards)** represent individual work items (tasks, stories, etc.) and are placed in the columns according to their current stage in the workflow.
- **Example:** Imagine a software development team's Kanban board. Columns might be: "Backlog," "Analysis," "Development," "Testing," "Deployment," "Done." A card representing a "User Story: Implement User Authentication" would move across these columns as it progresses through each stage.

> **Benefits of Visualization:**
> - **Transparency:** Everyone on the team and stakeholders can see the current status of work at a glance.
> - **Shared Understanding:** Provides a common understanding of the workflow and progress.
> - **Bottleneck Identification:** Visualizing the flow helps to quickly identify bottlenecks where work is getting stuck.

### 2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
Kanban emphasizes **limiting the amount of work in progress at any given stage**. WIP limits are set for each column on the Kanban board.

- **Example:** On our Kanban board, we might set a WIP limit of 3 for the "Development" column. This means that the team can only have a maximum of 3 cards in the "Development" column at any time. To start working on a new item, they must first complete and move a currently "In Development" item to the next stage (e.g., "Testing").

> [!TIP]
> **Benefits of WIP Limits:**
> - **Reduced Multitasking:** Forces focus on completing existing tasks before starting new ones, reducing the negative impacts of multitasking.
> - **Faster Flow:** By limiting WIP, bottlenecks are exposed and resolved more quickly, leading to a smoother and faster flow of work.
> - **Improved Quality:** Focusing on fewer items at once can lead to better quality and reduced errors.

### 3. Manage Flow
Kanban aims to **optimize the flow of work through the system**. The focus is on ensuring a smooth and continuous flow, minimizing delays, and maximizing throughput.

- **Example:** If the "Testing" column consistently has a backlog of cards, it indicates a bottleneck in the testing process. The team would then investigate why testing is slow and implement improvements (e.g., increase testing resources, automate tests, improve testing processes).

> [!NOTE]
> **Flow Metrics:** Kanban uses metrics like **cycle time** (time from start to finish of a work item) and **lead time** (time from request to delivery) to measure and improve flow.

> [!TIP]
> **Benefits of Flow Management:**
> - **Predictability:** Improved flow leads to more predictable delivery times.
> - **Efficiency:** Optimized flow reduces waste and improves overall efficiency.
> - **Faster Delivery:** By streamlining the workflow, features and value are delivered to users more quickly.

### Other Key Aspects of Kanban
- **Evolutionary Change:** Kanban is designed for incremental, evolutionary change. It starts with the existing workflow and gradually improves it over time.
- **No Prescribed Roles:** Unlike Scrum with its defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Scrum Team), Kanban does not mandate specific roles. Roles may emerge organically based on team needs.
- **Continuous Delivery:** Kanban is well-suited for continuous delivery environments where releases are frequent and incremental.
- **Flexibility:** Kanban is highly flexible and can be adapted to various types of work, not just software development. It's used in manufacturing, support, and other industries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **When to Consider Kanban over Scrum:**
> - **Continuous Flow of Work:** When work arrives in a continuous stream rather than in sprint-sized batches.
> - **Focus on Process Improvement:** When the primary goal is to optimize an existing process and achieve incremental improvements.
> - **Mature Teams:** Teams that are self-organizing and comfortable with less prescriptive frameworks might find Kanban a good fit.
> - **Support and Maintenance:** Kanban is often used for support and maintenance tasks where work is less predictable and needs to be handled as it arises.

> [!NOTE]
> **In summary, Kanban is a powerful Agile framework that emphasizes visualization, WIP limits, and flow management.** It offers a more flexible and evolutionary approach compared to Scrum and is particularly well-suited for continuous flow environments and process optimization.
