### [Deep Dive into Disciplined Agile (DA) – The Toolkit for Contextual Agility](Chapter%205%20Beyond%20Scrum%20–%20Exploring%20Other%20Frameworks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Disciplined%20Agile%20%28DA%29-%20The%20Toolkit%20for%20Contextual%20Agility.md)

This file describes Disciplined Agile as a process-decision toolkit rather than a strict framework. It explains how DA guides teams by helping them choose context-appropriate practices across governance, architecture, workflows, and delivery. The write-up focuses on DA’s decision-based approach to agility, emphasizing that there is no single best way—only the best way for a given situation.

### [Deep Dive into Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) – Business-Driven Agile](Chapter%205%20Beyond%20Scrum%20–%20Exploring%20Other%20Frameworks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Dynamic%20Systems%20Development%20Method%20%28DSDM%29-%20Business-Driven%20Agile.md)

This part examines DSDM as one of the earliest Agile-style frameworks, emphasizing business alignment, active user involvement, and fixed-time development cycles. It dives into DSDM’s structured principles that maintain agility while ensuring governance, making it ideal for organizations that need predictability alongside iterative delivery.

### [Deep Dive into Extreme Programming (XP) – Technical Excellence in Agile](Chapter%205%20Beyond%20Scrum%20–%20Exploring%20Other%20Frameworks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Extreme%20Programming%20%28XP%29-%20Technical%20Excellence%20in%20Agile.md)

This file explores XP, a framework that champions engineering excellence through practices like pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, and simple design. It explains how XP enhances quality, reduces defects, and accelerates feedback loops. The write-up highlights the technical rigor that makes XP an essential complement to Scrum in many modern engineering teams.

### [Deep Dive into Feature-Driven Development (FDD) – Feature-Centric Agile](Chapter%205%20Beyond%20Scrum%20–%20Exploring%20Other%20Frameworks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Feature-Driven%20Development%20%28FDD%29-%20Feature-Centric%20Agile.md)

This section explains FDD’s structured, model-driven approach centered on delivering user-valued features. It describes how FDD emphasizes upfront modeling, feature lists, and short iterative cycles. The commentary shows where FDD’s predictability and structured workflow can be advantageous, especially in large-scale systems with well-defined domains.

### [Deep Dive into Lean Software Development – Efficiency and Value Flow](Chapter%205%20Beyond%20Scrum%20–%20Exploring%20Other%20Frameworks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Lean%20Software%20Development-%20Efficiency%20and%20Value%20Flow.md)

This file introduces Lean principles such as eliminating waste, optimizing flow, and maximizing value. It explains how Lean thinking influences modern Agile practices and how it guides teams to focus on efficiency, learning, and customer value. The section connects Lean concepts to software delivery patterns like limiting WIP, improving flow, and continuous improvement.

### [Deep Dive into Scrumban – Blending Scrum and Kanban for Flexibility](Chapter%205%20Beyond%20Scrum%20–%20Exploring%20Other%20Frameworks/Deep%20Dive%20into%20Scrumban-%20Blending%20Scrum%20and%20Kanban%20for%20Flexibility.md)
