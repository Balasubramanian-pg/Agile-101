**Scrumban** is a hybrid Agile methodology that combines elements of **Scrum** and **Kanban**.

> [!NOTE]
> Scrumban is designed to offer a more flexible and less prescriptive approach than pure Scrum, while still retaining some of Scrum's structure. It's often used by teams transitioning from Scrum to Kanban, or by teams that want to incorporate flow-based practices into their existing Scrum framework to enhance responsiveness and handle variability.

### Understanding the Blend: Scrum + Kanban = Scrumban
Scrumban essentially takes the best aspects of both Scrum and Kanban and combines them to create a hybrid approach. Let's break down what elements are typically drawn from each framework:

#### From Scrum, Scrumban often adopts:

> [!TIP]
> - **Roles (Optional):** Scrumban teams often retain roles like Product Owner and Scrum Master (though their responsibilities may be adapted).
> - **Iterations (Sprints - Optional):** Scrumban *can* use time-boxed iterations, but they are often more flexible or replaced by a continuous flow model.
> - **Sprint Planning (Adapted):** If using sprints, a form of sprint planning is still employed, but it may be less rigid and more focused on just-in-time planning.
> - **Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up):** Daily meetings are often retained to maintain daily synchronization.
> - **Sprint Review and Retrospective (Optional):** These events may be adapted or made optional, especially when moving towards a more continuous flow.
> - **Prioritized Backlog:** A prioritized backlog, similar to a Scrum Product Backlog, is typically used to manage and order work.

#### From Kanban, Scrumban incorporates:
> [!TIP]
> - **Kanban Board (Visualization):** A Kanban board is a core element for visualizing the workflow.
> - **Work In Progress (WIP) Limits:** Limiting WIP is a key practice adopted to improve flow and identify bottlenecks.
> - **Pull System:** Work is "pulled" into the next stage only when capacity is available, controlled by WIP limits.
> - **Focus on Flow:** The primary emphasis is on optimizing the smooth and continuous flow of work.
> - **Continuous Delivery (Often):** Scrumban is often used in environments that aim for continuous or very frequent releases.
> - **Metrics for Flow:** Metrics like Cycle Time and Lead Time are used to measure and improve flow.

### Key Characteristics and Practices of Scrumban

#### 1. Visual Workflow with Kanban Board
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** Scrumban teams use a Kanban board to visualize their workflow with columns representing stages like "Backlog," "Ready," "In Development," "Testing," and "Done."
> - **Purpose:** To provide transparency, a shared understanding of the workflow, and visual tracking of progress.
> - **Example:** A physical or digital Kanban board with cards representing User Stories moving across the columns.

#### 2. Work In Progress (WIP) Limits
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** Limits are set for each stage of the workflow to restrict the amount of work that can be in progress at any given time.
> - **Purpose:** To improve flow by reducing multitasking, focusing teams on completion, and highlighting bottlenecks.
> - **Example:** Setting a WIP limit of 3 for the "In Development" column means only 3 work items can be in that stage simultaneously.

#### 3. Prioritized Backlog
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** Scrumban uses a prioritized backlog, often managed by a Product Owner, containing User Stories or features ordered by business value.
> - **Purpose:** To provide a single source of truth for all work and ensure the team works on the most valuable items first.
> - **Example:** A Product Backlog in Jira, prioritized by the Product Owner, containing stories ready to be pulled into the workflow.

#### 4. Pull System
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** Work is "pulled" through the workflow stages as capacity becomes available (i.e., when a stage is below its WIP limit).
> - **Purpose:** To optimize flow, reduce bottlenecks, and prevent overburdening the team.
> - **Example:** When a developer finishes a task, they "pull" the next highest priority item from the previous stage into their column, provided there is capacity.

#### 5. Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** Scrumban teams often retain the short, daily meeting to synchronize activities and identify impediments.
> - **Purpose:** To maintain daily communication, coordination, and transparency within the team.
> - **Example:** A 15-minute daily stand-up where team members discuss progress and any blockers.

#### 6. Planning (Just-in-Time or Iteration-Based)
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** Planning in Scrumban is flexible. It can be **Just-in-Time (JIT)**, happening continuously to replenish the "Ready" column as needed, or it can be **Iteration-Based**, similar to Sprint Planning but often shorter or more adaptable.
> - **Purpose:** To ensure a steady flow of prioritized work into the system and adapt to changing priorities.

#### 7. Reviews and Retrospectives (Optional and Adapted)
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** These Scrum ceremonies may be adapted. **Reviews** can become less formal and more continuous, happening as features are completed. **Retrospectives** remain valuable for continuous improvement but may be held less frequently or on an as-needed basis.
> - **Purpose:** To gather feedback on delivered work and inspect and adapt processes.

#### 8. Metrics for Flow and Efficiency
> [!NOTE]
> - **Description:** Scrumban teams often use Kanban metrics to measure and improve flow, such as **Cycle Time**, **Lead Time**, and **Throughput**.
> - **Purpose:** To track performance, identify bottlenecks, measure the impact of process improvements, and drive continuous optimization.

### When is Scrumban a Good Choice?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scrumban is often a suitable choice in these situations:
> - **Teams Transitioning from Scrum to Kanban:** It serves as a natural stepping stone.
> - **Maintenance and Support Teams:** It's well-suited for work that arrives in a continuous, unpredictable flow.
> - **Teams with Frequent Interruptions:** Its flexibility helps manage changing priorities and high variability.
> - **Teams Seeking Process Improvement:** It helps Scrum teams improve their flow and reduce bottlenecks.
> - **Projects with Continuous Delivery:** Its focus on flow is a good fit for frequent release cycles.
> - **Smaller Teams or Projects:** It can be effective where the overhead of full Scrum might be too heavy.

### Benefits and Challenges

> [!TIP]
> #### Benefits of Scrumban
> - **Increased Flexibility and Responsiveness:** Easily adapts to changing priorities and emergent work.
> - **Improved Flow and Efficiency:** WIP limits and visualization help optimize workflow and reduce bottlenecks.
> - **Reduced Overheads:** Can reduce the overhead associated with some Scrum ceremonies.
> - **Gradual Transition to Kanban:** Provides a smoother path for teams moving from Scrum.
> - **Supports Continuous Delivery:** Well-suited for teams focused on frequent releases.

> [!WARNING]
> #### Challenges and Considerations with Scrumban
> - **Potential for Losing Scrum Benefits:** If applied too loosely, teams might lose the discipline of clear sprint goals and regular feedback loops.
> - **Requires Team Discipline for WIP Limits:** Adhering to WIP limits requires commitment from the team.
> - **Balancing Structure and Flexibility:** Finding the right balance between Scrum's structure and Kanban's flexibility is key.
> - **Less Prescriptive Guidance:** Requires a self-organizing team to adapt the approach to their specific context.

### Conclusion

> [!NOTE]
> **Scrumban is a valuable hybrid Agile approach that offers a pragmatic blend of Scrum's structure and Kanban's flexibility.** It's particularly well-suited for teams transitioning from Scrum, maintenance teams, and environments requiring adaptability and flow optimization. By combining the iterative nature of Scrum with the flow-based practices of Kanban, Scrumban enables teams to achieve greater responsiveness, efficiency, and continuous delivery.
