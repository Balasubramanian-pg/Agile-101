To effectively work in an Agile environment, it's important to understand the common terminology:

- **Epic:**
    - An Epic is a **large, abstract description of a desired functionality or feature**. Think of it as a high-level user story or a major project goal.
    - Epics are intentionally broad and **lack detailed requirements**. They serve as placeholders for significant pieces of work that will be broken down further.
    - **Example:** "As a user, I want to be able to manage my customer accounts online so that I can access my account information and perform self-service tasks."
- **Feature (or Story):**
    - Features (or User Stories) are **more granular and specific breakdowns of Epics**. They represent a **concrete piece of functionality** that provides value to the user.
    - Stories are typically written from the **user's perspective** and follow a format like: "As a [user role], I want to [action] so that [benefit/reason]".
    - Features are **estimable and can be completed within a single iteration (sprint)**.
    - **Example (related to the Epic above):** "As a customer, I want to view my recent transaction history online so that I can track my spending."
- **Task:**
    - Tasks are the **smallest units of work** within the Agile hierarchy. They are **actionable steps** required to implement a Story or Feature.
    - Tasks are typically **technical and detailed**, outlining the specific activities a developer or team member needs to perform.
    - Tasks should be **easily assignable and trackable**.
    - **Example (related to the Feature above):**
        - "Create database query to fetch transaction data."
        - "Develop API endpoint to expose transaction data."
        - "Design and implement user interface to display transaction history."
        - "Write unit tests for transaction history functionality."

**Hierarchy Summary:**

> [!important] Epic (Broad Goal)<br>└── Feature/Story (Specific Functionality)<br>└── Task (Actionable Step)<br>

This hierarchical structure helps to break down large, complex projects into manageable pieces, making planning, development, and tracking progress more efficient and transparent.
