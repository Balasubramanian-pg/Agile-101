# Common Agile Terminology

To work effectively in an Agile environment, it's essential to understand the common terminology used to break down work.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Epic
> An Epic is a **large, abstract description of a desired functionality**. Think of it as a high-level user story or a major project goal.
>
> -   **Purpose:** Epics are intentionally broad and lack detailed requirements. They serve as placeholders for significant pieces of work that will be broken down later.
> -   **Example:** "As a user, I want to manage my customer account online so I can access my information and perform self-service tasks."

> [!NOTE]
> ### Feature (or User Story)
> A Feature or User Story is a **more specific breakdown of an Epic**. It represents a concrete piece of functionality that provides value to the user.
>
> -   **Format:** Stories are often written from the user's perspective: "As a [user role], I want to [action] so that [benefit]."
> -   **Scope:** They are small enough to be estimated and completed within a single iteration (sprint).
> -   **Example (from the Epic above):** "As a customer, I want to view my recent transaction history online so I can track my spending."

> [!NOTE]
> ### Task
> A Task is the **smallest unit of work** in the Agile hierarchy. It is an actionable step required to complete a User Story.
>
> -   **Nature:** Tasks are typically technical and detailed, outlining the specific activities a team member needs to perform.
> -   **Function:** They are easily assignable and trackable.
> -   **Example (from the Story above):**
>     -   "Create a database query to fetch transaction data."
>     -   "Develop an API endpoint to expose the data."
>     -   "Design the UI to display transaction history."
>     -   "Write unit tests for the functionality."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Agile Hierarchy**
>
> This structure helps break down large, complex projects into manageable pieces, making planning, development, and tracking progress more efficient and transparent.
>
> -   **Epic** (The Broad Goal)
>     -   **Feature / Story** (A Specific Piece of Functionality)
>         -   **Task** (An Actionable Step to Build It)
