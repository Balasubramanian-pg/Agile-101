Agile development operates in cycles, with key phases repeated in each iteration. These phases are not necessarily sequential and can often overlap or be performed concurrently:

1. **Plan:**
    - This phase involves defining the goals and objectives for the current iteration.
    - It includes **understanding user needs and requirements**, often through discussions with stakeholders and product owners.
    - **Prioritization** is crucial: deciding which features or stories will be developed in this iteration based on value and urgency.
    - **Sprint Planning meetings** are common in Scrum to collaboratively plan the work for the upcoming sprint.
2. **Implement (Develop):**
    - This is where the actual **coding and development** take place.
    - The development team works to build the features and functionalities planned for the current iteration.
    - **Best practices** like coding standards, version control (like Git), and continuous integration are often employed to ensure code quality and efficient workflow.
3. **Test (Quality Assurance):**
    - **Rigorous testing** is an integral part of each iteration.
    - This includes various levels of testing:
        - **Unit testing:** Testing individual components or modules of code.
        - **Integration testing:** Testing how different components work together.
        - **System testing:** Testing the entire system to ensure it meets requirements.
        - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Allowing stakeholders or end-users to test and provide feedback on the developed features.
    - **Automated testing** is often used to speed up the testing process and ensure consistency.
4. **Review (Inspect and Adapt):**
    - This phase is about **reflecting on the iteration** and identifying areas for improvement.
    - **Sprint Review meetings** (in Scrum) are held to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
    - **Sprint Retrospective meetings** (in Scrum) are internal team meetings to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to adapt processes for future iterations.
    - **Feedback from reviews is crucial**. If something is unsatisfactory or needs updates, the Agile approach allows you to **go back and iterate** on it in subsequent sprints. This continuous feedback loop is a core strength of Agile.

**Concurrent or Sequential Execution:** Agile teams have the flexibility to perform these phases concurrently or sequentially within an iteration. For instance, while some developers are implementing new features, others might be testing previously developed components, and planning for the next set of features can begin even before the current iteration is fully complete. This overlap maximizes efficiency and reduces bottlenecks.
