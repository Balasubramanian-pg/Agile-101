# The Agile Development Cycle

Agile development operates in cycles, with key phases repeated in each iteration. These phases are not always sequential and often overlap to maximize efficiency.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 1. Plan
> This phase involves defining the goals and objectives for the current iteration.
>
> -   **Understand Needs:** The team works with stakeholders and the product owner to understand user needs and clarify requirements.
> -   **Prioritize Work:** The team decides which features or user stories will be developed in this iteration based on business value and urgency.
> -   **Collaborate:** In frameworks like Scrum, **Sprint Planning** meetings are held to collaboratively plan the work for the upcoming sprint.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 2. Implement (Develop)
> This is where the actual coding and development of the software take place.
>
> -   **Build Features:** The development team works to build the functionalities planned for the current iteration.
> -   **Follow Best Practices:** To ensure quality and efficiency, teams employ coding standards, version control (like Git), and continuous integration.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 3. Test (Quality Assurance)
> Rigorous testing is an integral and continuous part of each iteration, not a separate final step.
>
> -   **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or modules of code.
> -   **Integration Testing:** Verifying how different components work together.
> -   **System Testing:** Testing the entire system to ensure it meets requirements.
> -   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Allowing stakeholders or end-users to test features and provide crucial feedback.
>
> **Automated testing** is often used to speed up this process and ensure consistency.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 4. Review (Inspect and Adapt)
> This phase is about reflecting on the iteration to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
>
> -   **Sprint Review:** The team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders to gather feedback on the product.
> -   **Sprint Retrospective:** The team meets internally to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to adapt its processes for future iterations.
>
> The feedback from these reviews is crucial. The Agile approach allows the team to **go back and iterate** on features in subsequent sprints, creating a powerful continuous feedback loop.

> [!TIP]
> **Concurrent vs. Sequential Execution**
>
> Agile teams have the flexibility to perform these phases concurrently. For instance, while some developers are implementing new features, others might be testing previously developed components. This overlap maximizes efficiency and reduces bottlenecks, allowing for a smoother, faster workflow.
