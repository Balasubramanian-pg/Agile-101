# Chapter 2 – Agile Lifecycle and Core Concepts

A detailed exploration of how Agile teams plan, execute, measure, and refine their work. This chapter expands the foundational ideas from Chapter 1 into practical, repeatable processes that drive real delivery.

### [Chapter 2.1 The Agile Development Lifecycle – Iterative Phases](Chapter%202%20Agile%20Lifecycle%20and%20Core%20Concepts/Chapter%202.1%20The%20Agile%20Development%20Lifecycle-%20Iterative%20Phases.md)

This section explains the full Agile development lifecycle, breaking down how work flows through initiation, planning, execution, review, and adaptation in repeated cycles. It clarifies how iterative development reduces risk and encourages continuous feedback. The write-up also highlights the contrast between a linear lifecycle and an evolving one, showing how teams refine both product and process with every iteration.

### [Chapter 2.2 Understanding Agile Terminology](Chapter%202%20Agile%20Lifecycle%20and%20Core%20Concepts/Chapter%202.2%20Understanding%20Agile%20Terminology.md)

This file serves as a glossary of core Agile terms. It explains frequently used phrases such as sprint, backlog, user story, acceptance criteria, capacity, and velocity. Beyond simple definitions, it provides context on why these terms matter and how they function inside Agile teams. The section ensures readers can interpret Agile discussions, ceremonies, and documentation with confidence.

### [Chapter 2.3 Agile Planning Horizons – Strategic, Release, and Iteration Planning](Chapter%202%20Agile%20Lifecycle%20and%20Core%20Concepts/Chapter%202.3%20Agile%20Planning%20Horizons-%20Strategic,%20Release,%20and%20Iteration%20Planning.md)

This part explores the different levels of planning within Agile: long-term strategic planning, mid-range release planning, and short-term iteration or sprint planning. It clarifies how Agile manages uncertainty by progressively refining scope instead of predicting everything upfront. The write-up shows how each planning horizon links together, ensuring the product vision guides near-term decisions without freezing the roadmap.

### [Chapter 2.4 Agile Metrics – Measuring Progress and Driving Improvement](Chapter%202%20Agile%20Lifecycle%20and%20Core%20Concepts/Chapter%202.4%20Agile%20Metrics-%20Measuring%20Progress%20and%20Driving%20Improvement.md)

This file details the quantitative and qualitative metrics that help Agile teams track progress and improve over time. It covers concepts such as velocity, cycle time, burndown charts, predictability, team health indicators, and flow efficiency. The commentary emphasizes that metrics are tools for learning rather than control, guiding teams toward better forecasting, smoother flow, and continuous improvement.

### [Chapter 2.5 Agile Estimation Techniques – Planning for Uncertainty](Chapter%202%20Agile%20Lifecycle%20and%20Core%20Concepts/Chapter%202.5%20Agile%20Estimation%20Techniques-%20Planning%20for%20Uncertainty.md)

This section outlines the estimation approaches used in Agile environments. It explains techniques such as planning poker, story points, t-shirt sizing, affinity estimation, and relative sizing. The write-up clarifies why Agile avoids time-based estimates in early stages and instead uses relative complexity to manage uncertainty. It also discusses how estimation supports prioritization, forecasting, and team alignment.
