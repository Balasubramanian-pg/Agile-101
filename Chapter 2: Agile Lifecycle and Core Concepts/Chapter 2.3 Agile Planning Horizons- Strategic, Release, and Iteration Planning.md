# Agile Planning Horizons

> [!INFO]
> **What are Planning Horizons?**
>
> Agile planning is not a one-time event but a continuous process that happens at different levels. **Planning Horizons** provide a framework for this by aligning the long-term product vision with the team's daily work.
>
> **Why are they important?**
> -   **Aligns Vision with Execution:** Ensures daily tasks contribute to strategic goals.
> -   **Enables Adaptive Planning:** Plans are reviewed and adjusted at each level.
> -   **Manages Uncertainty:** High-level plans are directional, while short-term plans are concrete and detailed.
> -   **Balances Long-Term and Short-Term:** Connects the long-term vision with short, iterative development cycles.

### The Three Agile Planning Horizons

> [!NOTE]
> ### 1. Strategic Planning (The Vision)
>
> **Focus:** Defines the long-term vision and strategic direction for the product. It answers *why* we are building the product and *what* problem it solves.
>
> **Timeframe:** Long-range, typically extending months to years.
>
> **Key Activities:**
> -   Defining a clear and compelling **Product Vision**.
> -   Creating a high-level **Product Roadmap** outlining major themes or features.
> -   Conducting market and competitive analysis.
> -   Assessing business value and potential return on investment (ROI).
>
> **Participants:** Product Owner, Product Management, Business Stakeholders, and Executives.
>
> **Deliverables:** A Product Vision Statement and a high-level Product Roadmap.
>
> **Example:** For a new fitness app, the vision might be: "To be the leading personalized fitness companion that empowers users to achieve their health goals through intelligent coaching." The roadmap would outline themes like "Core Tracking," "Personalized Coaching," and "Social Features" over the next two years.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 2. Release Planning (The Roadmap)
>
> **Focus:** Defines the scope and timeline for a specific product release. It answers *what* features will be included in the next major release and *when* it will be available.
>
> **Timeframe:** Medium-range, typically spanning several sprints (e.g., 2-6 months).
>
> **Key Activities:**
> -   Setting a clear and measurable **Release Goal**.
> -   Selecting and prioritizing User Stories from the backlog for the release.
> -   Creating a high-level timeline with key milestones.
> -   Identifying dependencies and potential risks.
>
> **Participants:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team.
>
> **Deliverables:** A Release Goal, a Release Backlog (the list of features for the release), and a high-level Release Plan.
>
> **Example:** For the fitness app, the first release goal could be: "Launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core run-tracking and workout logging to validate market interest." The release plan would then list all the user stories needed to achieve this over a 3-month period.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 3. Iteration Planning (The Sprint)
>
> **Focus:** Plans the detailed work for a single iteration (a sprint). It answers *how* the team will accomplish a small piece of the release goal.
>
> **Timeframe:** Short-term, lasting the duration of a single iteration (typically 1-4 weeks).
>
> **Key Activities:**
> -   Defining a clear **Sprint Goal**.
> -   Selecting User Stories from the release backlog to work on during the sprint.
> -   Breaking down user stories into smaller, actionable **tasks**.
> -   Creating the **Sprint Backlog** (the list of stories and tasks for the sprint).
>
> **Participants:** The entire Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team).
>
> **Deliverables:** A Sprint Goal and a detailed Sprint Backlog.
>
> **Example:** For the first sprint of the fitness app, the goal might be: "Develop the core user registration and profile setup functionality." The team would then break this down into tasks like "Design registration UI," "Build backend API," and "Implement email validation."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **How the Horizons Connect**
>
> The planning horizons are hierarchical and create a continuous feedback loop.
>
> -   **From Top to Bottom:** The **Strategic Vision** guides the creation of the **Release Plan**, which is then broken down into actionable **Iteration Plans**.
> -   **From Bottom to Top:** The outcomes and learnings from each **Iteration** provide feedback that helps adjust the **Release Plan**. The success and market feedback from each **Release** help refine the overall **Strategic Vision**.
>
> This structure ensures that even the smallest task is aligned with the long-term goals, while allowing the flexibility to adapt based on real-world results.
