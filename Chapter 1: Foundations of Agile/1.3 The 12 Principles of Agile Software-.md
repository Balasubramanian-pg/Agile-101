The Agile Manifesto is supported by 12 founding principles. They provide a more detailed, actionable guide for teams looking to implement Agile.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 1. Customer Satisfaction Through Early and Continuous Delivery
> The top priority is to satisfy the customer by delivering valuable software early and continuously. This ensures the customer sees progress and receives business value at regular intervals.
>
> **Example:** Instead of waiting a year for a full launch, an e-commerce company releases a working shopping cart feature within two months. This allows early users to make purchases while the rest of the platform is developed.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 2. Welcome Changing Requirements
> Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. Businesses operate in dynamic environments, so software must be flexible enough to adapt to shifting needs and market conditions, even late in development.
>
> **Example:** A banking app initially planned for manual transfers later integrates an AI-powered savings feature after customer feedback, even though development was already halfway through.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 3. Deliver Working Software Frequently
> Agile teams release small, functional increments of software in short sprints (typically 2–4 weeks). This ensures continuous value delivery and allows for quick adjustments based on real-world feedback.
>
> **Example:** A SaaS company releases a CRM tool with basic contact management first, followed by automated follow-ups and reporting dashboards in subsequent releases.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 4. Business and Developers Must Work Together Daily
> Close, daily collaboration between business stakeholders and developers is crucial. This ensures developers understand business goals, and business leaders understand technical constraints and possibilities.
>
> **Example:** A retail company’s product owner works closely with the software team, discussing customer pain points to ensure features align with real-world business operations.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 5. Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals
> Give teams the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Teams perform best when they are empowered and trusted to take ownership of their work. Micromanagement is discouraged.
>
> **Example:** A startup allows its developers to choose their own tools and working hours, as long as they meet sprint goals. This flexibility boosts productivity and innovation.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 6. The Most Effective Communication is Face-to-Face
> Direct, personal conversation is the most efficient and effective method of conveying information. Agile encourages daily stand-ups and real-time collaboration to resolve issues and align teams quickly.
>
> **Example:** A development team holds a 15-minute daily stand-up meeting where everyone discusses progress and obstacles, ensuring the entire team stays aligned.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 7. Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress
> Agile measures progress by what is delivered and functional. This approach shifts the focus from bureaucracy (like extensive documentation) to real-world impact.
>
> **Example:** Instead of creating a 200-page technical document, an Agile team delivers a basic but functional version of a website, allowing for early testing and tangible feedback.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 8. Promote Sustainable Development
> Agile processes promote a sustainable pace. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Burnout is avoided by setting realistic expectations.
>
> **Example:** A gaming company avoids "crunch time" by scheduling sprints realistically, allowing developers to deliver high-quality features without exhaustion.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 9. Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Teams prioritize high-quality code and clean architecture to prevent technical debt, which slows down future development.
>
> **Example:** A fintech company continuously refactors its code and follows test-driven development, ensuring the platform remains scalable and adaptable.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 10. Simplicity is Essential
> Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential. Agile promotes efficiency by focusing only on what is necessary and avoiding over-engineering or unnecessary features.
>
> **Example:** Instead of building a complex AI chatbot from day one, a support startup first implements a simple FAQ system that effectively addresses most user queries.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 11. Self-Organizing Teams Foster the Best Results
> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Rather than relying on top-down control, Agile encourages teams to collaborate, experiment, and find the optimal solutions on their own.
>
> **Example:** A development team working on a healthcare app collaboratively decides the best way to structure the database to ensure seamless data retrieval for medical professionals.

> [!NOTE]
> ### 12. Regular Reflection and Continuous Improvement
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. This is often done in retrospective meetings at the end of each sprint.
>
> **Example:** After noticing delays, a team introduces a pre-sprint planning session with stakeholders to refine user stories before development begins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Conclusion**
>
> These 12 Agile Principles provide a strong foundation for creating adaptive, customer-focused, and efficient software development processes. Understanding the Manifesto and its principles is crucial for grasping the essence of Agile. They guide teams toward delivering value effectively in a dynamic and changing environment.
