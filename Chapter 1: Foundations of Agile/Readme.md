### [1.1 What is Agile](Chapter%201%20Foundations%20of%20Agile/1.1%20What%20is%20Agile.md)

This section introduces Agile as a mindset rather than a rigid methodology. It explains how Agile prioritizes adaptability, continuous feedback, and incremental delivery over long, predictive planning cycles. The commentary also highlights why Agile emerged, the kinds of problems it solves, and how it reshapes team interactions. The purpose is to establish a solid philosophical base before exploring specific frameworks or techniques.

### [1.2 The Agile Manifesto and 12 Principles – The Foundational Values](Chapter%201%20Foundations%20of%20Agile/1.2%20The%20Agile%20Manifesto%20and%2012%20Principles-%20The%20Foundational%20Values.md)

This file explores the four core values of the Agile Manifesto and their impact on traditional delivery models. It further breaks down the twelve principles that guide Agile behaviour in real work environments, such as embracing changing requirements, delivering working software frequently, and fostering sustainable development. Practical examples help illustrate how these principles shape decisions and habits inside Agile teams.

### [1.3 The 12 Principles of Agile Software](Chapter%201%20Foundations%20of%20Agile/1.3%20The%2012%20Principles%20of%20Agile%20Software-.md)

This section digs deeper into the twelve principles with a focus on software development. Each principle is interpreted through the lens of engineering culture, highlighting themes like prioritizing technical excellence, reducing unnecessary work, and strengthening collaboration between business and technical stakeholders. The write-up helps readers understand how these principles directly influence coding practices, sprint structures, and delivery flow.

### [1.4 Agile vs. Waterfall – A Direct Comparison](Chapter%201%20Foundations%20of%20Agile/1.4%20Agile%20vs.%20Waterfall-%20A%20Direct%20Comparison.md)

This file presents a clear comparison of the Agile and Waterfall approaches. It explains how Waterfall relies on fixed, sequential phases, while Agile responds to uncertainty by iterating toward the solution. The comparison outlines when each model may be suitable, offering nuance instead of treating Agile as a universal replacement. It also touches on differences in customer involvement, risk management, and delivery timelines.
