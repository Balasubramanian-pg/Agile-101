# Chapter 1 - Foundations of Agile

A clear, practical overview of the core ideas that shape modern Agile thinking, and their significance.

## 1.1 What is Agile

This section introduces Agile as a mindset rather than a rigid methodology. The write-up explains how Agile focuses on adaptability, continuous feedback, and incremental delivery instead of long, predictive planning cycles. You’ll find an accessible breakdown of why Agile emerged, what kinds of problems it solves, and how it changes the way teams collaborate. The goal here is to ground readers in the philosophy before diving into frameworks or practices.

## 1.2 The Agile Manifesto and 12 Principles – The Foundational Values

This file walks through the Agile Manifesto and its four value statements. The commentary makes it clear how each value challenges traditional project management habits. It also explores the twelve principles that expand these values into practical guidance, such as embracing change, maintaining sustainable pace, and delivering working software frequently. The section translates these principles into relatable, everyday examples to show how they influence actual work.

## 1.3 The 12 Principles of Agile Software

This part provides a deeper, principle-by-principle interpretation aimed at software development teams. It elaborates on how each principle shapes engineering behaviours, such as prioritizing technical excellence, fostering close collaboration between business and development, and reducing work in progress. Readers get a more operational view of how these principles influence coding practices, planning rhythms, and delivery pipelines.

## 1.4 Agile vs. Waterfall – A Direct Comparison

This file contrasts Agile with the classic Waterfall model in a clean, side-by-side manner. It explains how Waterfall relies on sequential phases and heavy upfront planning, while Agile embraces uncertainty and iterates toward outcomes. The commentary clarifies when each approach might be appropriate, avoiding simplistic “Agile is always better” narratives. It also highlights differences in risk management, customer involvement, and delivery timelines.
