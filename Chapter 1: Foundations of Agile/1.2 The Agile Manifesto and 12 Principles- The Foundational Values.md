> [!Tip]
> The **Agile Manifesto**, created in 2001, is a concise statement of the values that underpin all Agile methodologies. It's the cornerstone of the Agile movement and provides a guiding philosophy for development.

### The Four Core Values

The manifesto emphasizes four core values, presented as a preference for one thing over another.

> [!Note]  
> **The Agile Manifesto**  
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.  
>
> Through this work we have come to value:  
> - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
> - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
> - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
> - **Responding to change** over following a plan  
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.


Let's break down what each value means in practice.

### 1. Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools

> [!NOTE]
> **Focus:** Prioritizes effective communication, collaboration, and self-organization within the team.
>
> **Explanation:** While processes and tools are important, Agile emphasizes that the creativity, problem-solving ability, and communication of individuals are more critical for success. A rigid process or a fancy tool cannot replace effective teamwork.
>
> **Example:** An Agile team values face-to-face communication and daily stand-up meetings more than strictly adhering to a complex, documented process or relying solely on automated tools for communication.

### 2. Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation

> [!NOTE]
> **Focus:** Delivering functional, usable software is the primary measure of progress.
>
> **Explanation:** While documentation has its place, Agile values working software that provides value to the user above all else. The emphasis is on delivering value quickly, with documentation being just enough to support the software and its users.
>
> **Example:** Instead of spending months creating detailed requirements documents before writing code, an Agile team builds a working prototype or a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). They iterate based on feedback, documenting only what's necessary.

### 3. Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation

> [!NOTE]
> **Focus:** Building strong, collaborative relationships with customers throughout the development process.
>
> **Explanation:** Agile promotes continuous collaboration with the customer to ensure the software meets their evolving needs. Instead of relying on a rigid, upfront contract, Agile promotes an ongoing dialogue and feedback loop to deliver the most valuable product.
>
> **Example:** An Agile team involves the customer in sprint reviews, demos, and feedback sessions throughout development. This constant interaction ensures alignment and allows for course correction as needed.

### 4. Responding to Change Over Following a Plan

> [!NOTE]
> **Focus:** Embracing change and adapting to evolving requirements and market conditions.
>
> **Explanation:** Agile recognizes that change is inevitable in software development. Instead of rigidly adhering to an initial plan, Agile methodologies are designed to be flexible. The ability to adapt to new information is a core strength.
>
> **Example:** If new information or changing market needs emerge, an Agile team is prepared to adjust the backlog and adapt the plan. They don't blindly stick to the original path.
