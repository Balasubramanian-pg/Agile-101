# What is a Sprint?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A **Sprint** is a **time-boxed period (typically 1-4 weeks)** during which a Scrum Team works to complete a set of tasks and achieve a specific **Sprint Goal**. Sprints are the fundamental building blocks of Scrum, providing a predictable rhythm for development.

### Key Aspects of a Sprint

> [!NOTE]
> -   **Time-boxed:** Sprints have a fixed duration, which creates a sense of urgency and focus. This constraint encourages efficient planning and execution.
> -   **Goal-Oriented:** Each sprint has a clear Sprint Goal that provides direction and alignment for the team.
> -   **Focused Work:** The work selected for a sprint is directly aligned with achieving the Sprint Goal.
> -   **Incremental Delivery:** Sprints focus on delivering small, valuable features, allowing for continuous feedback and faster value delivery.
> -   **Inspect and Adapt:** Each sprint ends with a cycle of inspection and adaptation to improve both the product and the process.

### The Sprint Lifecycle: Key Activities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sprints follow a consistent cycle of events, or ceremonies, that provide structure and opportunities for collaboration, inspection, and adaptation.

> [!NOTE]
> #### 1. Sprint Planning
> *(At the beginning of the sprint)*
>
> The team collaborates to:
> -   Define the **Sprint Goal**.
> -   Select user stories for the **Sprint Backlog**.
> -   Plan *how* the work will be accomplished.

> [!NOTE]
> #### 2. Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up)
> *(A 15-minute meeting held every day)*
>
> The team meets to:
> -   **Synchronize activities** and plan for the next 24 hours.
> -   **Identify and raise impediments** or roadblocks.
> -   **Improve communication** and collaboration.

> [!NOTE]
> #### 3. Sprint Review
> *(At the end of the sprint)*
>
> The team and stakeholders meet to:
> -   **Demonstrate the completed product increment**.
> -   **Gather feedback** on the new functionality.
> -   **Adapt the Product Backlog** based on feedback and market changes.

> [!NOTE]
> #### 4. Sprint Retrospective
> *(After the Sprint Review, before the next Sprint Planning)*
>
> The team meets to:
> -   **Reflect on the sprint process**: what went well, what could be improved, and what challenges were faced.
> -   **Create actionable steps** for continuous improvement in the next sprint.

Sprints provide a structured, iterative framework for Agile development, enabling teams to deliver value frequently, adapt to change, and continuously improve their processes.
