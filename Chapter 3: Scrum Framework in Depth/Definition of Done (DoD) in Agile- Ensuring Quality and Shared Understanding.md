# The Definition of Done (DoD)

> [!INFO]
> **What is the Definition of Done?**
>
> The Definition of Done (DoD) is a formal, shared checklist of criteria that a team uses to determine when a piece of work is truly "complete." It ensures quality, consistency, and transparency by creating a universal understanding of what "done" means for any user story or task.
>
> **Its Purpose:**
> -   Establishes a shared understanding of "done."
> -   Ensures consistent quality standards.
> -   Increases transparency for the team and stakeholders.
> -   Prevents the accumulation of partially finished or "undone" work.
> -   Guides development and testing efforts.

### Characteristics of a Good Definition of Done

> [!TIP]
> **Hallmarks of a Strong DoD**
>
> A good Definition of Done is a team agreement that is:
>
> -   **Clear and Unambiguous:** Written in simple language that everyone understands.
> -   **Specific and Measurable:** Criteria are objectively verifiable. Vague terms like "good" are avoided.
> -   **Comprehensive but Concise:** Covers all essential quality aspects without being overly bureaucratic.
> -   **Visible and Accessible:** Prominently displayed where the team can see it daily.
> -   **Regularly Adapted:** It's a living document that evolves with the team, often updated during Sprint Retrospectives.

### Example of a Definition of Done Checklist

> [!NOTE]
> A Definition of Done for a user story might include items like this:
>
> -   [ ] Code is written and meets team coding standards.
> -   [ ] Code has been peer-reviewed by at least one other developer.
> -   [ ] Unit tests are written and all tests are passing.
> -   [ ] Integration tests are passing.
> -   [ ] All Acceptance Criteria for the user story have been met and verified.
> -   [ ] The feature has been functionally tested.
> -   [ ] Security considerations have been addressed.
> -   [ ] The code is successfully integrated into the main development branch.
> -   [ ] Relevant documentation (code comments, API docs) is updated.
> -   [ ] The Product Owner has reviewed and accepted the story.

### Levels of "Done"

> [!NOTE]
> It's common for teams to think about "Done" at multiple levels:
>
> 1.  **Story-Level DoD:** The checklist applied to every user story within a sprint.
> 2.  **Sprint-Level DoD:** The criteria for the entire sprint's increment to be considered "done" and potentially releasable. This is often the same as the Story-Level DoD.
> 3.  **Release-Level DoD:** A broader checklist for a product release, which may include larger-scale activities like performance testing, final security audits, and stakeholder sign-off.

### Who Defines the DoD and When?

> [!TIP]
> -   **Who:** The entire **Scrum Team** (Development Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master) collaboratively defines and agrees upon the DoD. This ensures shared ownership and commitment.
> -   **When:** The initial DoD is established **early in a project**. It is then reviewed and refined periodically, most commonly during **Sprint Retrospectives**, as the team matures and learns.

### Benefits of a Clear DoD

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A strong Definition of Done is crucial because it leads to:
>
> -   **Improved Quality:** Drives higher-quality software by setting clear standards.
> -   **Reduced Technical Debt:** Minimizes "undone" work that can slow down future development.
> -   **More Accurate Forecasting:** Creates a reliable basis for measuring velocity, leading to better predictions.
> -   **Increased Team Confidence:** The team knows exactly what is expected for their work to be complete.
> -   **Better Stakeholder Communication:** Provides a transparent definition of what "done" means for delivered features.

> [!NOTE]
> In summary, the Definition of Done is a cornerstone of Agile quality practices. By collaboratively defining, implementing, and continuously improving their DoD, Agile teams can deliver high-quality, valuable software increments with greater predictability and confidence.
